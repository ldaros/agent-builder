# agent-builder

A flexible and configurable library for building agents that interact with large language models (LLMs).
This library streamlines the process of creating sophisticated agents, enabling reusable components for diverse tasks.

## Overview

`agent-builder` provides a robust framework for constructing agents capable of handling various tasks, from straightforward text processing to complex interactions with external tools.  It focuses on modularity and extensibility, allowing you to easily adapt and customize the agent's behavior.

## Key Features

* **LLM Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with various large language models (LLMs), including OpenAI, Google AI, and OpenRouter models.
* **Tool Execution:**  Handles the execution of external tools, allowing your agents to interact with the real world.
* **Flexible Parsing:** Supports different output formats from LLMs through customizable parsers. Currently includes JSON parsing, but easily extensible.
* **Internationalization (i18n):**  Utilizes `i18next` for internationalization, allowing agents to be localized easily.
* **Modular Design:**  Built with a modular architecture, making it easy to add new models, parsers, and tools.
